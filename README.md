# DIS-PIPE
DIS-PIPE provides scalable integration of process mining techniques and artificial intelligence algorithms to learn the structure of Big Data pipelines by extracting, processing, and interpreting vast amounts of event data collected from several data sources. Furthermore, DISPIPE supports a variety of analytics techniques for visualizing
the discovered pipelines together with detailed diagnostics information about their execution.

The architecture of the DIS-PIPE consists of two software components referred to as [DIS-PIPE-Event-Log-Manager](https://github.com/DataCloud-project/DIS-PIPE-Event-Log-Manager) and [DIS-PIPE-Discovery-And-Visualization](https://github.com/DataCloud-project/DIS-PIPE-Discovery-And-Visualization) as shown in the figure below.
