# DIS-PIPE
DIS-PIPE provides scalable integration of **process mining** techniques and **artificial intelligence** algorithms to learn the structure of **Big Data pipelines** by extracting, processing, and interpreting vast amounts of event data collected from several data sources. Furthermore, DIS-PIPE supports a variety of analytics techniques for visualizing
the discovered pipelines together with detailed diagnostics information about their execution.

In particular, the functionalities provided by DIS-PIPE include:
- *Event data extraction*: which analyzes data sources to detect the main constituents of a data pipeline execution;
- *Segmentation*: which clusters together the events belonging to the same pipeline executions;
- *Abstraction*: which reduces the complexity of the event data set by merging multiple events into larger ones;
- *Filtering*: which removes potential outliers and infrequent events from the data set;
- *Pipeline discovery*: which learns the structure of a data pipeline by interpreting an event log generated by applying the previous functionalities over the event data set;
- *Pipeline map visualization*: providing an understandable flowchart view of a discovered pipeline, which facilitates the analysis of execution metrics, such as duration, frequent paths, or exceptional behaviors;
- *Event log analysis*: which enables inspecting the history of relevant pipeline executions collected in the event log and understanding specific aspects, including timeframe,
variation, attributes, event relationships, and many more;
- *Compliance checking*: of the pipeline executions as observed into the event log with the organizationâ€™s business rules, policies, and regulations;
- *Anomaly detection*: which interprets the compliance checking outcomes signaling nonconforming deviations and providing repair solutions.

The architecture of the DIS-PIPE consists of two software components referred to as [DIS-PIPE-Event-Log-Manager](https://github.com/DataCloud-project/DIS-PIPE-Event-Log-Manager) and [DIS-PIPE-Discovery-And-Visualization](https://github.com/DataCloud-project/DIS-PIPE-Discovery-And-Visualization) as shown in the figure below.
