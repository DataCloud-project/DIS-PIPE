# DIS-PIPE Walkthrough
In the following we provide a walkthrough of the various steps required to execute DIS-PIPE and interact with its graphical user interface (GUI). For the sake of understandability, we evaluate the interaction with the GUI by relying on a real-world data pipeline provided by JOT, one of the business case partners in the project. The JOT pipeline involves the management of digital marketing campaigns.
